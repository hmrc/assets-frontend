This Component Library demonstrates styles and components for **HMRC** applications. It is built on top of the [GOV.UK frontend toolkit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit) and the [GOV.UK template](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template) and it uses the [hmrc-component-library-template](https://github.com/hmrc/component-library-template).

## What is the Component Library?

The Component Library is the generated output of [HMRC assets-fronted](https://github.com/hmrc/assets-frontend) stylesheets. It allows Designers and Developers to see what components we have across the Tax Platform.


## Adding Components

You can see information about how to add a comment which will enable a component to be rendered in the Component Library by visiting the [HMRC assets-fronted wiki](https://github.com/hmrc/assets-frontend/wiki/Component-Library).


## Discussing Changes

We have setup a **Components** collection on the [HMRC Digital Hackpad](https://hmrcdigital.hackpad.com/collection/EU4v7qZDRel). Every component page in the Component Library has a link to the hackpad page of the same name. This is the place to discuss what you would like for you components.


## Support Channels

We have Slack channels for questions around the Component Library. You'll need a government email address to join them.
* [Slack channel for Community UX](https://hmrcdigital.slack.com/messages/community-ux/)
* [Slack channel for Community Frontend](https://hmrcdigital.slack.com/messages/community-frontend/)


## Reporting Issues / Actioning work
### Components

Once a decision has been made by the design team on a component the work needs to be raised and the component needs to be written/changed. To do this please raise an issue in [HMRC assets-fronted issues](https://github.com/hmrc/assets-frontend/issues) and attach the `component library` label to it.

### Template

If you would like to discuss extra features or the design of the template itself please raise an issue in [HMRC component-library-template issues](https://github.com/hmrc/component-library-template/issues).
