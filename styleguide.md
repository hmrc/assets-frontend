This Component Library demonstrates styles and components for **HMRC** applications. It is built on top of the [GOV.UK frontend toolkit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit) and the [GOV.UK template](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template) and it uses the [hmrc-component-library-template](https://github.com/hmrc/component-library-template).

## What is the Component Library?

The Component Library is the generated output of [HMRC assets-fronted](https://github.com/hmrc/assets-frontend) stylesheets. It allows Designers and Developers to see what components we have across the Tax Platform.


## Adding Components

You can see information about how to add a comment which will enable a component to be rendered in the Component Library by visiting the [HMRC assets-fronted wiki](https://github.com/hmrc/assets-frontend/wiki/Component-Library).


## Discussing Changes

We have setup a **Components** collection on the [HMRC Digital Hackpad](https://hmrcdigital.hackpad.com/collection/EU4v7qZDRel). Every component page in the Component Library will have a hackpad page of the same name. This will be the place to discuss what you would like for you components.


## Reporting Issues / Actioning work - Components

Once a decision has been made by the design team on a component the work needs to be raised and the component needs to be written/changed. To do this please raise an issue in [HMRC assets-fronted issues](https://github.com/hmrc/assets-frontend/issues) and attach the `component library` label to it.


## Development details

All the information you need to know for developing and enabling Components within the Component Library can be found can be found in the [assets-frontend](https://github.com/hmrc/assets-frontend) README.

## Reporting Issues / Actioning work - Template

If you would like to discuss extra features or the design of the template itself please raise an issue in [HMRC component-library-template issues](https://github.com/hmrc/component-library-template/issues).
