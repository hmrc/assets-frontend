# Deprecation

:rotating_light: **Assets Frontend has been deprecated in favour of the [Play Frontend](https://www.github.com/hmrc/play-frontend-hmrc).** :rotating_light:

If you do decide to use Assets Frontend anyway you need to be aware of the vulnerabilities including but not limited to the ones listed here ]https://github.com/hmrc/assets-frontend/security/dependabot](https://github.com/hmrc/assets-frontend/security/dependabot).  There are also known accessibility issues when using Assets Frontend which will cause delays with going live.  As of 13th October 2021, we won't be making updates to Assets Frontend so we recommend moving over to the latest [Play Frontend Libraries](https://confluence.tools.tax.service.gov.uk/display/PLATUI/play-frontend+Libraries)

# assets-frontend

This repository contains the source files and documentation for the Components & Design Patterns used to design and build digital services for the HMRC Tax Platform.

It provides additional styles on top of the [GOV.UK styles](govuk-elements).


# Quick Start

## Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) `== 4.8.4`
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) `>= 2.11.3`

To install multiple versions of Node.js, you may find it easier to use a node version manager:

* [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
* [n](https://github.com/tj/n)

## Installation

Clone this repository and install its dependencies:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/hmrc/assets-frontend.git
$ cd assets-frontend
$ npm install
```

## Running

### The Component Library microsite
1. Clone the repo locally: `git clone https://github.com/hmrc/assets-frontend.git`
2. In your file system, navigate to the assets-frontend directory: `cd assets-frontend`
3. Checkout the `gh-pages` branch: `git checkout gh-pages`
4. In your file system, navigate one directory level above the `assets-frontend` folder: `cd ../`
5. Start a local server for serving the pages: `python3 -m http.server --cgi 8888`
6. In the browser, navigate to to `http://localhost:8888/assets-frontend`

### The Design System:

1. Run `npm start`
2. The Design System is available at http://localhost:9034/
3. Latest V4 Assets are then available at http://localhost:9032/assets/v4-SNAPSHOT/...
4. Latest V3 Assets are then available at http://localhost:9032/assets/v3-SNAPSHOT/...

### To access both the Design System and the Component Library [DEPRECATED]

1. Run `npm run dev:all` or `./server.sh dev`
2. The Design System is available at http://localhost:9034/
3. The Component Library is available at http://localhost:9033/

### To run a specific version of Assets Frontend locally

1. Run `./server.sh`
2. V4 Assets are then available at http://localhost:9032/assets/4.11.0/...
3. V3 Assets are then available at http://localhost:9032/assets/3.11.0/...

# Usage

## Using assets locally

### Prototypes

For now, the quickest and simplest way to add assets-frontend to your prototype is to grab the built CSS and JS from production.

Just replace `<VERSION>` in the links below with the [released version](https://github.com/hmrc/assets-frontend/releases) you want to use (we recommend using the latest).

If your prototype is based on the [GOV.UK prototype kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit/) then do the following:

**CSS**

Save the file found at
[https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/assets/\<VERSION\>/stylesheets/application.min.css](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/assets/\<VERSION\>/stylesheets/application.min.css)
to `/app/assets/sass/assets-frontend.css`.

And add the following to `app/views/includes/head.html`:
```
<link href="/public/stylesheets/assets-frontend.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
```

**JavaScript**

Save the file found at
[https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/assets/\<VERSION\>/javascripts/application.min.js](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/assets/\<VERSION\>/javascripts/application.min.js)
to `/app/assets/javascripts/assets-frontend.js`

And add the following to `app/views/includes/head.html`
```
<script src="/public/javascripts/assets-frontend.js"></script>
```

## Frontends

If your frontend is based on [init-service](https://github.com/hmrc/init-service/), then you just need to make sure the configuration for assets in the [application.conf](https://github.com/hmrc/init-service/blob/f9a55c100faa8b13d2a1a869c0531f6e3a7b556c/templates/service/conf/application.conf#L73-L77) file has the line `version = ${?ASSETS_FRONTEND_VERSION}` after declaring the actual version.

Once it has, you just need to set an environment variable before running your frontend:

```
$ ASSETS_FRONTEND_VERSION=999-SNAPSHOT sbt run
```

If you’re using [service-manager](https://github.com/hmrc/service-manager), please read the [service manager guidance in the Wiki](https://github.com/hmrc/assets-frontend/wiki/Using-service-manager).


## Using assets in production

Running `npm run release` calls the [release gulp task](https://github.com/hmrc/assets-frontend/blob/main/gulpfile.js/tasks/release.js) and this happens on our internal Jenkins instances.

The final step of our internal release pipeline is to version and deploy the compiled assets to https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/assets/.

Releasing assets for use in production is currently a process owned by the [Service Design Tools](https://github.com/orgs/hmrc/teams/service-design-tools) team.

If you’d like a new version of assets-frontend released, please get in touch with us in the [#team-sdt](https://hmrcdigital.slack.com/messages/C39V3PH38) Slack channel.


# HMRC Design System

The [HMRC Design System can be viewed here](http://hmrc.github.io/assets-frontend/).

For detailed information on how the HMRC Design System works, please read the [Design System page in the Wiki](https://github.com/hmrc/assets-frontend/wiki/HMRC-Design-System).


# Component Library - [DEPRECATED]

:rotating_light: **The Component Library has been deprecated in favour of the [HMRC Design System](http://hmrc.github.io/assets-frontend/).**:rotating_light:

If your service relies on a component or pattern that doesn’t appear in the HMRC Design System then please follow the [Design System contribution guidelines](https://github.com/hmrc/assets-frontend/wiki/HMRC-Design-System#contributing-a-design-pattern).

For detailed information on how the Component Library works, please read the [Component Library guidance in the Wiki](https://github.com/hmrc/assets-frontend/wiki/Component-Library-%5BDEPRECATED%5D).
