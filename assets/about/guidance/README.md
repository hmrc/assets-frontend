# How to contribute a component or pattern to the HMRC Design System

You should design your service using [GOV.UK design patterns, components and styles] (https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design). If the thing you need is not there, you should use the [HMRC Design System] (http://hmrc.github.io/assets-frontend/). If you still cannot meet the needs of your users proven by user research, then you can adapt an existing pattern or component, or create a new one. Styles should not be changed without good reason, and any changes should be done in collaboration with GDS.

You must share it (together with your research findings) with the rest of the tax platform, using the HMRC Design System. To do this, you should [raise an issue] (https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) on the [HMRC Design Patterns repository] (https://github.com/hmrc/design-patterns/issues) on GitHub (you do not need to know how to use Git to do this).

To be considered for inclusion in the HMRC Design System, your pattern or component must be Useful and Unique. GOV.UK defines useful and unique like this:

////TABLE////

In the issue, you should clearly explain how your pattern or component meets these standards and include any user research findings you have.

A member of the [HMRC Design System Working Group] (https://github.com/orgs/hmrc/teams/design-system-working-group) will respond to your issue.
