Images

Because displays now come at different pixel densities, we require higher res imagery to display clearly for all browsers.  This means:
Use images at least 1200px wide if they are to sit in a full column;
Use tools like optiPNG or imageOptim to minify the file size of the image if using PNG.
Use lossy compression sparingly for images containing many colours, and double check quality with a designer.

Markup:
<div>
  <img src="/assets/images/bank-account-last-4-digits.png"/>
</div>
