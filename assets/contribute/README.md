# Contribute to the HMRC Design System

You should design your service using [GOV.UK styles, components and patterns](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design). If the thing you need is not there, you should use the [HMRC Design System](http://hmrc.github.io/assets-frontend/). If you still cannot meet the needs of your users proven by user research, then you can adapt an existing pattern or component, or create a new one. Styles should not be changed without good reason, and any changes should be done in collaboration with GDS.

You must share your new component or pattern (together with your research findings) with the rest of the tax platform, using the HMRC Design System. You can [view guidance](contribute/how-to-contribute/index.html) on how to contribute your component or pattern.

To be considered for inclusion in the HMRC Design System, your pattern or component must be Useful and Unique. GOV.UK defines useful and unique like this:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Standard</th>
      <th scope="col">Component or pattern</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Useful</td>
      <td>It addresses a user need that’s shared by multiple services</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Unique</td>
      <td>It should meet a unique user need which isn’t currently met by another component in the Design System (unless intended to replace it)</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>
When you contribute to the Design System, you should clearly explain how your pattern or component meets these standards and include any user research findings you have.

A member of the [HMRC Design System Working Group](https://github.com/orgs/hmrc/teams/design-system-working-group) will respond to your issue.
