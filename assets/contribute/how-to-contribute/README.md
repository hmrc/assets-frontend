# How to contribute to the HMRC Design System

To contribute a component or pattern, you should [raise an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) on the [HMRC Design Patterns repository](https://github.com/hmrc/design-patterns/issues) on GitHub (you do not need to know how to use Git to do this).

First, check whether an issue has already been raised using the search function. If it has, you can add your findings to the existing issue.

If it hasn’t, you should use the following blank template to provide your component or pattern and supporting findings:

# [Name of component/pattern]

# [Name of your service]

### Overview
Use this section to:

- explain, in one line, how the pattern helps users
- show a live example - if this is not possible because the pattern is bigger than one screen, you can use screenshots or provide a direct link to a section of a journey on a prototype

### When to use this [pattern/component]
Describe when to use this pattern/component. When is it appropriate to use and what need does it help you meet?

If necessary, include an additional H3 titled ‘When not to use this pattern’. Use this section to highlight any exceptions or known scenarios where the pattern does not work. If you include this section, explain what to use instead (with a relevant link if we’re suggesting an alternative pattern).

### How it works
Use this section to explain how the pattern works. This should include:

- (if the pattern/component is too complex to have been fully described in the overview) a full description of how the pattern works (for users)
- rules/instructions on how to implement it
- steps to follow

It can also include:

- coded examples
- things to avoid
- why it works

If this section is quite long, break it into smaller sections with H3s.

### Research on this pattern
Summarise and link to documentation of research relating to this pattern and describe any gaps or questions you still need to answer.
