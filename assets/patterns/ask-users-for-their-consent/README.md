## When to use this pattern

Use this pattern to ask a user for their consent when you collect and store personal data.

## How it works

Consent cannot be inferred by someone just using a service or doing nothing. It must be:

- freely given
- a positive action to opt-in
- clear, concise and specific
- separate from other terms and conditions
- as easy to withdraw as to give

Do not select radio buttons and checkboxes for users. This means the positive action would opt-out.

Consent covers all activities done for the same reason. If there is more than one reason the data is used, get separate consent for each reason.

### Ask a yes-no question
