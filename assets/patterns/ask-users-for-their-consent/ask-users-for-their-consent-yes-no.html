<p>You can choose to get electronic communications instead of letters from HMRC.</p>

<p>These electronic communications include statutory notices, decisions, estimates and reminders relating to your tax affairs, such as notices to file a tax return, make a payment, penalties due, or information about other matters.</p>

<p>When you have a new electronic communication we will send you an email notification requiring you to log in to your HMRC online account.</p>
